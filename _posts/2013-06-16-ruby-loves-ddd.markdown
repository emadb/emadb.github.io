On 14th june, in Milan, I spoke at the [rubyday](http://rubyday.it), and I presented a possible implementation of Domain Driven Design (with CQRS and Event Sourcing).
I know quite well the principles and patterns of DDD since we used them in some applications developed by [CodicePlastico](http://codiceplastico.com), but I never tried to do the same with Ruby. The main reason of my experiment is that in C#, implementing this kind of architectures, means writes lots of infrastructure code and sometimes it is difficult to find the best design due to the constraints of the static language.
So the choise of ruby was to evaluate if we can gain advantange from dynamic language. 
Well, I'm not a real rubyist so the proposed implementation could not be so "rubyistic" as I would like.

The source code is here [https://github.com/emadb/ruby_loves_ddd](https://github.com/emadb/ruby_loves_ddd) and I really hope that someone will fork it.

I will explain the code on this blog soon.
