I have more than ten years of experience as a software developer, don’t know if I have to be happy or to be sad for the time that pass. 
During these years I saw lot of technologies, frameworks, libraries passing, some of them are still here but most of them are dead. 
As a young dev I was super excited to have the opportunity to try some of them, I remember the excitement when a new version of the library xyz came out (in alpha edition) with the promise to solve all the problems (that probably I even didn’t have).
But as I said most of them are passed by and today we look at them with a sort of “it seemed a good idea, but it was wrong”.


So what remains of them? 


**The principles**. The principles are still here and every pattern even if it was born in the eighties it is still used today and almost certainly we will use them in the future.


Thats why the developers should spend more time on learning the principles than on learning how to use a framework, because in every framework the principles remains valid and *good software is built on good principles*.

So it's time to go back to SOLID, KISS, DRY, YAGNI and so on....
