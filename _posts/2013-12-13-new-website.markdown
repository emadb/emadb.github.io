Today we launched our new company web site. You can view it here: [http://codiceplastico.com](http://codiceplastico.com).
We are very happy to show the world our new image and to spread our new message [#codeforjustice](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23codeforjustice). We are tired to view bad programs, messy codebases, complex code and we created a movement of wise developers that strive for better code. 
We love beauty, we love high performance applications, we love well designed code and with our new web site we want to spread this message. Join us on twitter with the hashtag [#codeforjustice](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23codeforjustice).

[Gummy industries](http://www.gummyindustries.com) helped us a lot with their ideas and with the implementation, they are a group of smart crazy guys [@bia_hvid](http://twitter.com/bia_hvid), [@betone](http://twitter.com/betone), [@pietro_colella](http://twitter.com/pietro_colella), [@giorgiomininno](http://twitter.com/giorgiomininno), [@michelebertoli](http://twitter.com/michelebertoli) and [@ilgadaldi](http://twitter.com/ilgadaldi).

You will know more about our job in the next days....
